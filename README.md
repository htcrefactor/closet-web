# closet-web
###Closet is my personal front-end focused web project for 2019 OSAM, an event hosted by the Ministry of Defence of ROK.
This project is prioritized in practitioning open source, especially Vue.js and Element-UI.

Closet is a site that allows users to match tops and bottoms(clothes) they own, helping the user choose their outfit of the day.
Below is a wireframe design of the website made with [Balsamiq](balsamiq.cloud)

###Key UI elements implemented in this project are...
1. Cover Flow
2. Accordion Menu

###Features that I aim to implement are...
[ ] Cover flow, allowing the user to match tops and bottoms.
[ ] Recommending color matches based on a pre-selected item's color, e.g., if a navy color top is selected, bottoms are filtered to only display items with the color aesthetically appealing and harmonious with the top.
[ ] Coordination sharing with other users.

###Thanks!
