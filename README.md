# closet-web
### Closet is my personal front-end focused web project for 2019 OSAM, an event hosted by the Ministry of Defence of ROK.
This project is prioritized in practitioning open source, especially Vue.js and Element-UI.

Closet is a site that allows users to match tops and bottoms(clothes) they own, helping the user choose their outfit of the day. Below is a wireframe design of the website made with Balsamiq.

[Wireframe Design of Closet]

Key UI elements implemented in this project are...
[x] Cover Flow
[x] Accordion Menu

Features that I aim to implement are...
[ ] Cover flow, allowing the user to match tops and bottoms.
[ ] Recommending color matches based on a pre-selected item's color, e.g., if a navy color top is selected, bottoms are filtered to only display items with the color aesthetically appealing and harmonious with the top.
[ ] Implementing an accordion menu, mainly used to filter items.

# Thanks!
