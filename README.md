# closet-web
Closet is my personal front-end focused web project for 2019 OSAM, an event hosted by the Ministry of Defence of ROK.

This project is prioritized in practitioning open source, especially Vue.js and Element.ui.

Closet is a site that allows users to match tops and bottoms(clothes) they own, helping the user choose their outfit of the day.
